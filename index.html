    <p>They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon</p>
    <h3></h3>
    <Div class="box"><p>A Northwest tradition of excellence, Pat's salmon cookies are a staple of Northwest cuisine. Sourced from local non farmed raised line caught salmon, we take the salmon and mince the meat. Using a secret recipe discovered by accident one night when Pat had a peculiar craving. </p></Div>
