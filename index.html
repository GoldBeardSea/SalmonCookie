    <p>They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon</p>
    <h3></h3>
    <Div class="box"><p>A Northwest tradition of excellence, Pat's salmon cookies are a staple of Northwest cuisine. Sourced from local non farmed raised line caught salmon, we take the salmon and mince the meat. Using a secret recipe discovered by accident one night when Pat had a peculiar craving. </p></Div>

    <p>We are a family owned and operated business. The fact of the matter is, we adopt all of our workers into our family. Well ok, not legally, but we love our dedicated staff and offer educational, medical, dental, and savings benefits. You can catch us not just in Seattle but at events around the Sound. Like Issaquah's very own Salmon Days Festival. Where we go and set up shop in the festival as a sponser and food vendor. </p>
